# Unity-Cube-Chunk
Just some testing with cubes in Unity. Stores different kind of blocks in multidimensional array. (Script only)

Make 4 prefabs from cubes and change the name according to the code. (Or change the code). Then add this script to unity. Don't forget to add some textures to the cubes!

#There are some dutch comments, Sorry.
